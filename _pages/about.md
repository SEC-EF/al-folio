<p>The <b>SEC-EF</b> group exists to inform early-career members of the particle physics community about research activities within the Snowmass [Energy Frontier](https://snowmass21.org/energy/start), which aims to determine the most promising means to explore the TeV-scale and beyond.</p>

<p>This page exists to collect our regular digests of EF activities relevant to early-career researchers.</p>
