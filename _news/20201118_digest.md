### General news

***

   * Save the date! The Spring Energy Frontier Workshop will be May 10th - 14th, 2021.

   * There is an [Ongoing Energy Frontier survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFq5o6wPqC9qTPtqrycIcaaZY22HF77Zf59jlLiNqa2uebHw/viewform).

   * The second Snowmass Early-Career “Big Questions” Colloquium will take places this Friday, 20 November at 12pm Eastern, on the topic of Neutrino Physics! Register for the event to receive connection details [here](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46055/)!
      * Although the topic is not LHC-related, these talks are intended for non-specialists (in this case, non-neutrino-physicists) as the primary audience, in order to present an inspiring overview of the Big Questions in adjacent fields.
      * If you missed the first edition about Dark Matter, you can get caught up with the recording on the new [Snowmass Early-Career YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcYqE2aSgCc)

   * In order to request Monte Carlo samples for Snowmass studies, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQL\
