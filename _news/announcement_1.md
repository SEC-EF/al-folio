## General news

There is an Energy Frontier survey currently being performed by the EF conveners, collecting CPM feedback. Please fill it out [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFq5o6wPqC9qTPtqrycIcaaZY22HF77Zf59jlLiNqa2uebHw/viewform).

The Monte Carlo task force is looking for volunteers to help with preparing MC production over the winter break. There is room for participants at all career stages to help with the production. Please sign up using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJZnoE_gl6a8tfkF8mW2ArbBsaVyBL5iKsfkBy2E7Tuwu1NQ/viewform).

## Topical group updates

###### EF01 : Higgs properties & couplings
  * Last meeting on 22 October was on the topic of Higgs CP and di-Higgs production, recording available here: https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45835/
  * Next meeting on 5 November on the topic of H(invisible) and Higgs couplings: https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45873/
  * We do not presently have an early-career liaison for this topical group! If you are interested in the position, please contact Grace & Matt.


###### EF02 : Higgs portal to BSM
  * Next meeting 12 November, continuing a review of LOI submissions (details will be announced soon)
  * Joint EF01-EF02: There is an ongoing series of meetings related to di-Higgs production, and an effort to define a set of “benchmarks” for use in the community. Stay tuned for the next meeting times.


###### EF03 : Heavy flavour and top physics

    * We discussed LLPs with CMS at the HL-LHC, disappearing tracks at muon colliders, LLP searches with FCC-ee, and had a discussion on benchmark models
  * The next EF09 meeting will be on 13th Nov and will cover new fermions and other exotica


###### EF10 : Dark Matter at colliders
  * The last EF10 meeting was on the 21 October, focussed on searches for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, light Higgs and electroweakinos: https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46093/
  * EF10 is currently going through the list of submitted LOIs, and checking for updates with the groups who submitted LOIs.
