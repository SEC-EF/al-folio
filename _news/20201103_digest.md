### General news

***

  * There is an Energy Frontier (EF) survey currently being performed by the EF conveners, collecting feedback about the Community Planning Meeting. Please fill it out [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFq5o6wPqC9qTPtqrycIcaaZY22HF77Zf59jlLiNqa2uebHw/viewform).

  * The Monte Carlo (MC) task force is looking for volunteers to help with preparing MC production over the winter break. There is room for participants at all career stages to help with the production. Please sign up using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJZnoE_gl6a8tfkF8mW2ArbBsaVyBL5iKsfkBy2E7Tuwu1NQ/viewform).

  * In order to request MC samples for Snowmass studies, please use [this  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFNHgbXMoqtp1TGJO1KjvPdiA22ZvW-NuhTD1bBr9ZpRG0Dw/viewform).

### Topical group updates

***

##### EF01 : Higgs properties & couplings
  * Last meeting on 22 October was on the topic of Higgs CP and di-Higgs production, recording available here: [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45835/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45835/)
  * Next meeting on 5 November on the topic of H(invisible) and Higgs couplings: [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45873/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45873/)
  * We do not presently have an early-career liaison for this topical group! If you are interested in the position, please contact Grace & Matt via the [Snowmass slack](https://snowmass2021.slack.com/).


##### EF02 : Higgs portal to BSM
  * Next meeting 12 November, continuing a review of LOI submissions (details will be announced soon)
  * Joint EF01-EF02: There is an ongoing series of meetings related to di-Higgs production, and an effort to define a set of “benchmarks” for use in the community. Stay tuned for the next meeting times.


##### EF03 : Heavy flavour and top physics
  * Next meeting on 5 November, with discussion on top physics at LHeC and FCCeh: [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46132/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46132/)


##### EF04 : Precision EW physics
  * News


##### EF05 : Precision QCD physics
  * A series of meetings reviewing the submitted LOIs is ongoing:
    * 26 October, LOIs on precision calculations : [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46101/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46101/)
    * 12 October, LOIs on strong coupling determination : [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45893/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45893/)


##### EF06 : Hadronic structure and forward QCD
  * Joint EF05-EF06 white paper preparation on precision PDFs and relevant calculations (11/01/2020): [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46116/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46116/)
  * Joint EF06-EF07 jamboree meeting dedicated to transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) PDFs and observables (10/28/2020): [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45581/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/45581/)
  * Joint EF06-EF07 meeting on heavy flavour physics at the future Electron Ion Collider (10/20/2020): [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46005/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46005/)


##### EF07 : Heavy ions
  * The last EF07 meeting was on 2 November, on the topic of heavy flavour physics in heavy-ion collisions: [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46201/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46201/).


##### EF08 : Model-specific BSM
  * The most recent meeting was on 29 October ([https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46210/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46210/)). We had dedicated talks about the BSM sensitivity of a muon collider and the LHeC/FCC-eh. We also had two talks about using ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions to search for SUSY, axion-like particles, and other BSM scenarios
  * An informal group has been created to work on pMSSM scans to understand our projected sensitivity to realistic SUSY models. The first meeting is taking place on Wednesday, 4 November: [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46307/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46307/)
  * There have been two dedicated, informal meetings about targeting electroweak SUSY with compressed mass spectra. The indico category for these meetings is here: [https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1221/](https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1221/)


##### EF09 : Model-specific BSM
  * The last EF09 meeting was focused on Long-Lived Particles and searches at different detectors [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46184/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46184/)
    * We discussed LLPs with CMS at the HL-LHC, disappearing tracks at muon colliders, LLP searches with FCC-ee, and had a discussion on benchmark models
  * The next EF09 meeting will be on 13th Nov and will cover new fermions and other exotica


##### EF10 : Dark Matter at colliders
  * The last EF10 meeting was on the 21 October, focussed on searches for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, light Higgs and electroweakinos: [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46093/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/46093/)
  * EF10 is currently going through the list of submitted LOIs, and checking for updates with the groups who submitted LOIs.
