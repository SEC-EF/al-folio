<p>Collide for a (virtual) coffee with another Snowmass participant to build a new connection. We'll find you someone to talk to, so you can just think about the future of particle physics!</p>

<p>Participants will be matched based on shared interests, but across career stages, institutes and collaborations.</p>

<p><h2>The sign-up period has closed!<br>We are currently matching participants.</h2></p>

<p>Conversation prompts ...</p>

<p>We'd like to hear from you after your collision! Please send a message using our <a href="">feedback form</a>.</p>
